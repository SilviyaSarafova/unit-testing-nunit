## Testing Summator class, Averager class and Collection class with NUnit

1. The **Summator class** sums int and double values.
2. The **Averager class** represents the average value of an array of int and double.
3. The **Collection class** represents operations with arrays. The arrays may contain int, double, bool, string, or they can be nested.

*I reached **100%** code coverage in each project.*
